# Skeleton Code Generator

Skeleton Code Generator is a UML class diagram editor that generates Java code in real time. It also features automatic setter/getter generation, association diagrams, syntax highlighting, toString/hashCode/equals and javadoc generation.

This project was developed at my high school HTL Spengergasse when I was 15 years old.
